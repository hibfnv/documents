QUOTA(1)                      General Commands Manual                     QUOTA(1)



NAME
       quota - display disk usage and limits

SYNOPSIS
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -guqvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm ]]
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm ]] -u user...
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm ]] -g group...
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswugQm ] -f filesystem...

DESCRIPTION
       quota displays users' disk usage and limits.  By default only the user quo‐
       tas are printed.

       quota reports the quotas of all the filesystems listed in  /etc/mtab.   For
       filesystems  that  are  NFS-mounted a call to the rpc.rquotad on the server
       machine is performed to get the information.

OPTIONS
       -F, --format=format-name
              Show quota for specified format (ie. don't perform format autodetec‐
              tion).  Possible format names are: vfsold Original quota format with
              16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format  with  32-bit  UIDs  /  GIDs,
              64-bit  space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota for‐
              mat with 64-bit quota limits and usage, rpc (quota  over  NFS),  xfs
              (quota on XFS filesystem)

       -g, --group
              Print group quotas for the group of which the user is a member.  The
              optional group argument(s) restricts the display  to  the  specified
              group(s).

       -u, --user
              flag is equivalent to the default.

       -v, --verbose
              will display quotas on filesystems where no storage is allocated.

       -s, --human-readable
              option  will  make  quota(1) try to choose units for showing limits,
              used space and used inodes.

       --always-resolve
              Always try to translate user / group name to uid / gid even  if  the
              name is composed of digits only.

       -p, --raw-grace
              When  user  is  in  grace period, report time in seconds since epoch
              when his grace time runs out (or has run out). Field is '0' when  no
              grace  time  is  in  effect.  This is especially useful when parsing
              output by a script.

       -i, --no-autofs
              ignore mountpoints mounted by automounter

       -l, --local-only
              report quotas only on local  filesystems  (ie.  ignore  NFS  mounted
              filesystems).

       -A, --all-nfs
              report  quotas  for all NFS filesystems even if they report to be on
              the same device.

       -f, --filesystem-list
              report quotas only for filesystems specified on command line.

       -m, --no-mixed-pathnames
              Currently, pathnames of NFSv4 mountpoints are sent  without  leading
              slash  in the path.  rpc.rquotad uses this to recognize NFSv4 mounts
              and properly prepend pseudoroot of NFS filesystem to  the  path.  If
              you specify this option, quota will always send paths with a leading
              slash. This can be useful for legacy reasons but be aware that quota
              over RPC will stop working if you are using new rpc.rquotad.

       -q, --quiet
              Print  a more terse message, containing only information on filesys‐
              tems where usage is over quota.

       -Q, --quiet-refuse
              Do not print error message if connection to rpc.rquotad  is  refused
              (usually  this  happens  when  rpc.rquotad  is  not  running  on the
              server).

       -w, --no-wrap
              Do not wrap the line if the device name is too  long.  This  can  be
              useful when parsing the output of quota(1) by a script.

       --show-mntpoint
              Show also mount point as a filesystem identification.

       --hide-device
              Do not show device name in a filesystem identification.

       Specifying  both -g and -u displays both the user quotas and the group quo‐
       tas (for the user).

       Only the super-user may use the -u flag and the optional user  argument  to
       view  the  limits  of other users.  Non-super-users can use the the -g flag
       and optional group argument to view only the limits of groups of which they
       are members.

       The -q flag takes precedence over the -v flag.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If  quota  exits  with  a non-zero status, one or more filesystems are over
       quota.

FILES
       aquota.user  or  aquota.group
                           quota file at the filesystem  root  (version  2  quota,
                           non-XFS filesystems)
       quota.user  or  quota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem root (version 1 quota,
                           non-XFS filesystems)
       /etc/mtab           default filesystems

NAME
       quotacheck  -  scan  a  filesystem for disk usage, create, check and repair
       quota files

SYNOPSIS
       quotacheck [ -gubcfinvdMmR ] [ -F quota-format ] -a | filesystem

DESCRIPTION
       quotacheck examines each filesystem, builds a table of current disk  usage,
       and  compares  this  table against that recorded in the disk quota file for
       the filesystem (this step is omitted if option -c  is  specified).  If  any
       inconsistencies  are  detected,  both the quota file and the current system
       copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the  latter  only  occurs  if  an
       active  filesystem is checked which is not advised).  By default, only user
       quotas are checked.  quotacheck expects each filesystem to  be  checked  to
       have quota files named [a]quota.user and [a]quota.group located at the root
       of the associated filesystem.  If a file is not  present,  quotacheck  will
       create it.

       If  the  quota  file is corrupted, quotacheck tries to save as much data as
       possible.  Rescuing data may need user  intervention.  With  no  additional
       options  quotacheck  will simply exit in such a situation. When in interac‐
       tive mode (option -i) , the user is asked for advice. Advice  can  also  be
       provided  from  command  line  (see  option -n) , which is useful when quo‐
       tacheck is run automatically (ie. from script) and failure is unacceptable.

       quotacheck should be run each time the system boots  and  mounts  non-valid
       filesystems.  This is most likely to happen after a system crash.

       It is strongly recommended to run quotacheck with quotas turned off for the
       filesystem. Otherwise, possible damage or loss to data in the  quota  files
       can  result.   It  is also unwise to run quotacheck on a live filesystem as
       actual usage may change during the scan.  To prevent this, quotacheck tries
       to  remount  the  filesystem read-only before starting the scan.  After the
       scan is done it remounts the filesystem read-write. You  can  disable  this
       with option -m.  You can also make quotacheck ignore the failure to remount
       the filesystem read-only with option -M.

OPTIONS
       -b, --backup
              Forces quotacheck to make backups of the quota file  before  writing
              the new data.

       -v, --verbose
              quotacheck  reports  its  operation  as  it progresses.  Normally it
              operates silently.  If the option is specified twice, also the  cur‐
              rent directory is printed (note that printing can slow down the scan
              measurably).

       -d, --debug
              Enable debugging mode.  It will result in a lot of information which
              can be used in debugging the program. The output is very verbose and
              the scan will be slow.

       -u, --user
              Only user quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems specified
              are to be checked.  This is the default action.

       -g, --group
              Only  group  quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems speci‐
              fied are to be checked.

       -c, --create-files
              Don't read existing quota files. Just perform a new scan and save it
              to  disk.   quotacheck  also  skips scanning of old quota files when
              they are not found.

       -f, --force
              Forces checking and writing of new quota files on  filesystems  with
              quotas  enabled.  This is not recommended as the created quota files
              may be out of sync.

       -M, --try-remount
              This flag forces checking of filesystem  in  read-write  mode  if  a
              remount  fails. Do this only when you are sure no process will write
              to a filesystem while scanning.

       -m, --no-remount
              Don't try to remount filesystem read-only. See comment  with  option
              -M.

       -i, --interactive
              Interactive  mode.  By  default  quotacheck  exits  when it finds an
              error. In interactive mode user is asked  for  input  instead.   See
              option -n.

       -n, --use-first-dquot
              If  the  quota  files become corrupted, it is possible for duplicate
              entries for a single user or group ID to exist.   Normally  in  this
              case,  quotacheck  exits or asks user for input. When this option is
              set, the first entry found is always  used  (this  option  works  in
              interactive mode too).

       -F, --format=format-name
              Check  and  fix  quota  files of specified format (ie. don't perform
              format auto-detection). This is recommended as detection  might  not
              work  well  on  corrupted  quota  files.  Possible format names are:
              vfsold Original quota format with 16-bit UIDs /  GIDs,  vfsv0  Quota
              format  with  32-bit  UIDs  / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode
              usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit  quota  limits  and
              usage, rpc (quota over NFS), xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)

       -a, --all
              Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in /etc/mtab

       -R, --exclude-root
              When  used  together  with the -a option, all filesystems except for
              the root filesystem are checked for quotas.


NOTE
       quotacheck should only be run by super-user. Non-privileged users are  pre‐
       sumably not allowed to read all the directories on the given filesystem.

QUOTAON(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   QUOTAON(8)



NAME
       quotaon, quotaoff - turn filesystem quotas on and off

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/quotaon [ -vugfp ] [ -F format-name ] filesystem...
       /usr/sbin/quotaon [ -avugfp ] [ -F format-name ]

       /usr/sbin/quotaoff [ -vugp ] [ -x state ] filesystem...
       /usr/sbin/quotaoff [ -avugp ]

DESCRIPTION
   quotaon
       quotaon  announces  to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one
       or more filesystems. The filesystem quota files must be present in the root
       directory  of the specified filesystem and be named either aquota.user (for
       version 2 user quota), quota.user (for version 1 user quota),  aquota.group
       (for version 2 group quota), or quota.group (for version 1 group quota).

       XFS  filesystems  are  a  special case - XFS considers quota information as
       filesystem metadata and uses journaling to provide a higher level guarantee
       of  consistency.   There  are  two components to the XFS disk quota system:
       accounting and limit  enforcement.   XFS  filesystems  require  that  quota
       accounting  be  turned on at mount time.  It is possible to enable and dis‐
       able limit enforcement on an  XFS  filesystem  after  quota  accounting  is
       already  turned on.  The default is to turn on both accounting and enforce‐
       ment.

       The XFS quota implementation does not maintain quota information  in  user-
       visible files, but rather stores this information internally.

   quotaoff
       quotaoff announces to the system that the specified filesystems should have
       any disk quotas turned off.

OPTIONS
   quotaon
       -F, --format=format-name
              Report quota for specified format (ie. don't perform format  autode‐
              tection).   Possible  format names are: vfsold Original quota format
              with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs,
              64-bit  space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota for‐
              mat with 64-bit quota limits and usage, xfs (quota on  XFS  filesys‐
              tem)

       -a, --all
              All  automatically mounted (no noauto option) non-NFS filesystems in
              /etc/fstab with quotas will have their quotas turned  on.   This  is
              normally used at boot time to enable quotas.

       -v, --verbose
              Display a message for each filesystem where quotas are turned on.

       -u, --user
              Manipulate user quotas. This is the default.

       -g, --group
              Manipulate group quotas.

       -p, --print-state
              Instead  of  turning  quotas  on  just  print  state  of quotas (ie.
              whether. quota is on or off)

       -x, --xfs-command enforce
              Switch on limit enforcement for XFS filesystems. This is the default
              action  for  any  XFS  filesystem. This option is only applicable to
              XFS, and is silently ignored for other filesystem types.

       -f, --off
              Make quotaon behave like being called as quotaoff.

   quotaoff
       -F, --format=format-name
              Report quota for specified format (ie. don't perform format  autode‐
              tection).   Possible  format  names  are:  vfsold (version 1 quota),
              vfsv0 (version 2 quota), xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)

       -a, --all
              Force all filesystems in /etc/fstab to have their quotas disabled.

       -v, --verbose
              Display a message for each filesystem affected.

       -u, --user
              Manipulate user quotas. This is the default.

       -g, --group
              Manipulate group quotas.

       -p, --print-state
              Instead of turning quotas  off  just  print  state  of  quotas  (ie.
              whether. quota is on or off)

       -x, --xfs-command delete
              Free  up the space used to hold quota information (maintained inter‐
              nally) within XFS.  This option is only applicable to  XFS,  and  is
              silently ignored for other filesystem types.  It can only be used on
              a filesystem with quota previously turned off.

       -x, --xfs-command enforce
              Switch off limit enforcement  for  XFS  filesystems  (perform  quota
              accounting only). This is the default action for any XFS filesystem.
              This option is only applicable to XFS, and is silently  ignored  for
              other filesystem types.

       -x, --xfs-command account
              This  option can be used to disable quota accounting. It is not pos‐
              sible to enable quota accounting by quota tools.  Use  mount(8)  for
              that.  This  option  is  only  applicable to XFS filesystems, and is
              silently ignored for other filesystem types.

NOTES ON XFS FILESYSTEMS
       To enable quotas on an XFS filesystem, use  mount(8)  or  /etc/fstab  quota
       option  to  enable  both accounting and limit enforcement.  quotaon utility
       cannot be used for this purpose.

       Turning on quotas on an  XFS  root  filesystem  requires  the  quota  mount
       options  be passed into the kernel at boot time through the Linux rootflags
       boot option.

       To turn off quota limit enforcement on any XFS filesystem, first make  sure
       that  quota accounting and enforcement are both turned on using repquota -v
       filesystem.  Then, use quotaoff -v filesystem to disable limit enforcement.
       This may be done while the filesystem is mounted.

       Turning  on  quota limit enforcement on an XFS filesystem is achieved using
       quotaon -v filesystem.  This may be done while the filesystem is mounted.

FILES
       aquota.user or aquota.group
                           quota file at the filesystem  root  (version  2  quota,
                           non-XFS filesystems)
       quota.user or quota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem root (version 1 quota,

NAME
       edquota - edit user quotas

SYNOPSIS
       edquota  [  -p  protoname  ]  [  -u |  -g ] [ -rm ] [ -F format-name ] [ -f
       filesystem ] username...

       edquota [ -u | -g ] [ -F format-name ] [ -f filesystem ] -t

       edquota [ -u | -g ] [ -F format-name ] [  -f  filesystem  ]  -T  username |
       groupname...

DESCRIPTION
       edquota is a quota editor.  One or more users or groups may be specified on
       the command line. If a number is given in the place of user/group  name  it
       is  treated  as an UID/GID. For each user or group a temporary file is cre‐
       ated with an ASCII representation of the current disk quotas for that  user
       or group and an editor is then invoked on the file.  The quotas may then be
       modified, new quotas added, etc.  Setting a quota to zero indicates that no
       quota should be imposed.

       Block  usage  and  limits  are  reported  and  interpereted as multiples of
       kibibyte (1024 bytes) blocks by default. Symbols K, M,  G,  and  T  can  be
       appended  to  numeric value to express kibibytes, mebibytes, gibibytes, and
       tebibytes.

       Inode usage and limits are interpreted literally. Symbols k, m,  g,  and  t
       can  be appended to numeric value to express multiples of 10^3, 10^6, 10^9,
       and 10^12 inodes.

       Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a grace period that may
       be  specified  per filesystem.  Once the grace period has expired, the soft
       limit is enforced as a hard limit.

       The current usage information in the file is  for  informational  purposes;
       only the hard and soft limits can be changed.

       Upon  leaving the editor, edquota reads the temporary file and modifies the
       binary quota files to reflect the changes made.

       The editor invoked is vi(1) unless either the EDITOR or the VISUAL environ‐
       ment variable specifies otherwise.

       Only the super-user may edit quotas.

OPTIONS
       -r, --remote
              Edit  also  non-local  quota use rpc.rquotad on remote server to set
              quota.  This option is available only if quota tools  were  compiled
              with  enabled support for setting quotas over RPC.  The -n option is
              equivalent, and is maintained for backward compatibility.

       -m, --no-mixed-pathnames
              Currently, pathnames of NFSv4 mountpoints are sent  without  leading
              slash  in the path.  rpc.rquotad uses this to recognize NFSv4 mounts
              and properly prepend pseudoroot of NFS filesystem to  the  path.  If
              you specify this option, edquota will always send paths with a lead‐
              ing slash. This can be useful for legacy reasons but be  aware  that
              quota over RPC will stop working if you are using new rpc.rquotad.

       -u, --user
              Edit the user quota. This is the default.

       -g, --group
              Edit the group quota.

       -p, --prototype=protoname
              Duplicate  the  quotas  of  the prototypical user specified for each
              user specified.  This is the normal  mechanism  used  to  initialize
              quotas for groups of users.

       --always-resolve
              Always  try  to translate user / group name to uid / gid even if the
              name is composed of digits only.

       -F, --format=format-name
              Edit quota for specified format (ie. don't perform format autodetec‐
              tion).  Possible format names are: vfsold Original quota format with
              16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format  with  32-bit  UIDs  /  GIDs,
              64-bit  space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota for‐
              mat with 64-bit quota limits and usage, rpc (quota  over  NFS),  xfs
              (quota on XFS filesystem)

       -f, --filesystem filesystem
              Perform  specified  operations only for given filesystem (default is
              to perform operations for all filesystems with quota).

       -t, --edit-period
              Edit the soft time limits for each filesystem.  In old quota  format
              if   the   time   limits  are  zero,  the  default  time  limits  in
              <linux/quota.h> are used. In new quota format time  limits  must  be
              specified  (there  is no default value set in kernel). Time units of
              'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', and 'days' are understood. Time  lim‐
              its  are  printed  in  the greatest possible time unit such that the
              value is greater than or equal to one.

       -T, --edit-times
              Edit time for the user/group when softlimit  is  enforced.  Possible
              values  are  'unset' or number and unit. Units are the same as in -t
              option.

FILES
       aquota.user or aquota.group
                           quota file at the filesystem  root  (version  2  quota,
                           non-XFS filesystems)
       quota.user or quota.group
                           quota  file  at  the  filesystem root (version 1 quota,
                           non-XFS filesystems)

NAME
       repquota - summarize quotas for a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/repquota  [  -vspiug ] [ -c | -C ] [ -t | -n ] [ -F format-name ]
       filesystem...

       /usr/sbin/repquota [ -avtpsiug ] [ -c | -C ] [ -t | -n ] [ -F format-name ]

DESCRIPTION
       repquota prints a summary of the disc usage and quotas  for  the  specified
       file  systems.   For  each  user  the current number of files and amount of
       space (in kilobytes) is printed, along  with  any  quota  limits  set  with
       edquota(8)  or setquota(8).  In the second column repquota prints two char‐
       acters marking which limits are exceeded. If user is over his  space  soft‐
       limit  or reaches his space hardlimit in case softlimit is unset, the first
       character is '+'. Otherwise the character printed is '-'. The second  char‐
       acter denotes the state of inode usage analogously.

       repquota  has  to translate ids of all users/groups to names (unless option
       -n was specified) so it may take a while to print all the  information.  To
       make  translating  as fast as possible repquota tries to detect (by reading
       /etc/nsswitch.conf) whether entries are stored in standard plain text  file
       or  in  a  database and either translates chunks of 1024 names or each name
       individually. You can override this autodetection by -c or -C options.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              Report on all filesystems indicated in /etc/mtab  to  be  read-write
              with quotas.

       -v, --verbose
              Report  all  quotas, even if there is no usage. Be also more verbose
              about quotafile information.

       -c, --cache
              Cache entries to report and translate  uids/gids  to  names  in  big
              chunks  by  scanning all users (default). This is good (fast) behav‐
              iour when using /etc/passwd file.

       -C, --no-cache
              Translate individual entries. This is faster  when  you  have  users
              stored in database.

       -t, --truncate-names
              Truncate  user/group names longer than 9 characters. This results in
              nicer output when there are such names.

       -n, --no-names
              Don't resolve UIDs/GIDs to names. This can speedup printing a lot.

       -s, --human-readable
              Try to report used space, number of used inodes and limits  in  more
              appropriate units than the default ones.

       -p, --raw-grace
              When  user  is  in  grace period, report time in seconds since epoch
              when his grace time runs out (or has run out). Field is '0' when  no
              grace  time  is  in  effect.  This is especially useful when parsing
              output by a script.

       -i, --no-autofs
              Ignore mountpoints mounted by automounter.

       -F, --format=format-name
              Report quota for specified format (ie. don't perform format  autode‐
              tection).   Possible  format names are: vfsold Original quota format
              with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs,
              64-bit  space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota for‐
              mat with 64-bit quota limits and usage, xfs (quota on  XFS  filesys‐
              tem)

       -g, --group
              Report quotas for groups.

       -u, --user
              Report quotas for users. This is the default.

       Only the super-user may view quotas which are not their own.
